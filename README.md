Description: 
𝑀 stands for plaintext, 𝐻 stands for Hash function, 𝐸 stands for encryption algorithm, 𝐷 stands for decryption algorithm, 𝑅𝐾_𝐴  stands for sender 𝐴's private key, and 𝑈𝐾_𝐴 stands for the sender 𝐴’s public key, 𝑅𝐾_𝐵 stands for the sender 𝐵's private key, 𝑈𝐾_𝐵   stands for the sender 𝐵's public key, | | stands for combination. 
The shaded part represents the encrypted result. 

Contents: 
The symmetric encryption algorithm includes DES and AES, which are optional in the program; 
The Hash algorithm includes SHA and MD5, which are optional in the program; 
Asymmetric encryption algorithm RSA, the program can generate different private key and public key pair; 
It can not only realize the string signature and encryption, but also realize the file signature and encryption; 
The graphic process is completed in a program.

# The main file is CurProjectDlg.cpp
